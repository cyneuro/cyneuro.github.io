# ![](/images/cyneurologo.png) CyNeuro Tutorials and Tools

This website contains a collection of web-based tutorials and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks discussing the various topics of [Computational Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience). These notebooks provide an introduction to basic neuroscience, differential equations, single cell analysis, large scale neural networks, and signal processing. Many pages are available in an interactive manner and should be run this way to take full advantage of the content. Some of these pages are loosely based on lectures in the undergradute/graduate course "Computational Neuroscience" developed by [Satish Nair](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/satish-s-nair/), [Neural Engineering Lab](https://engineering.missouri.edu/academics/eecs/neuro/), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri.
