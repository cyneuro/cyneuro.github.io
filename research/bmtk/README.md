## About BMTK

The Brain Modeling Toolkit ([BMTK](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/)) is a python-based software package for creating and simulating large-scale neural network models. It supports building, simulation and analysis of models of different levels of resolution including:

* Biophysically detailed networks.
* Point neuron networks.
* Filter models.
* Population-level networks.

The BMTK was developed and is supported at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and released under a BSD 3-clause license. We encourage others to use the BMTK for their own research, and suggestions and contributions to the BMTK are welcome.
